Install issues:

[done] chmod 755 /usr/local/share/randomhelper

[done] Add to qrand 'run' file, line 13:
if [ -e ./qrand ] && ! [ -x ./qrand ] ; then
  chmod 700 ./qrand
fi


qrand binary needs to be updated to use stdlib 6

qrand config needs to only ask for password once

make sure qrand credentials are not included in package

raise lower level to 2500 or even 3000?

randomhelper-add needs to either be chmod 750 or it's test to see who the owner is needs to be fixed

config file needs to be documented so others know what things like size= means,
and could put in lower entrophy level

qrand is at http://random.irb.hr/index.php
can I distibute the binary file with the program?
