Program to add entropy to linux kernel using (hopefully) secure sources. The 
sources depend on what plugins you decide to use.

You should see the README for information on plugins, priorites, and warnings.

To install, simply run

[ as user ] ./configure

You may have to install some perl modules like Time::Date and such. The configure
script will check for these and let you know about problems.
  
[ as root ] ./install.sh
