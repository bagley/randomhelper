Program to add entropy to linux kernel using (hopefully) secure sources. The sources depend on what plugins you decide to use.

You should see the README for information on plugins, priorites, and warnings.

You may have to install some perl modules. You need Date::Format (libtimedate-perl on debian). The others are usually part of perl core: File::Temp, Time::HiRes, MIME::Base64, Sys::Syslog, and File::Basename. The configure script will check for these and let you know about problems.

To install, simply run

[ as user ] ./configure

Verify output summary.

[ as root ] ./install.sh
