(done) munin plugin error on install

user add fixes (look at an autoinstall type program like make or perl make?)

/etc/init.d/randomhelper: line 101: log_daemon_msg: command not found

(done) selinux context for munin access to stats file
still need to test whether a selinux update will reset context of stats file
if so, wee need to use
  semanage fcontext -a -t munin_var_run_t -f -- $stats_file

Stats file needs to be in its own folder
perhaps we should add a selinux context?

All settings should reside in /etc/randomhelper
- plugin settings, user names, passwords 
  (thus no need to chown plugin dir to randonhelper, and this 
   could be troublesome for a user adding new plugins)
- stats file location and context
- user=randomhelper
- data dir
>>> make it so the user will _never_ have to edit /usr/sbin/random-*


move random-get to random-add in git tree, preserving history


maybe change the database from one file to multiple files, and have random-add 
cycle through them, deleting them as he is done with them. Perhaps 100 files 
would be enough. random-collect would add files as nessacarry. This has the 
benifit that if random-collect takes hours to sort the data, random-add does not
have to wait for it to be done (file locks).

This could also be done with a database, though I don't see the benifit except from
not having to lock files. And sqlite slows down on larger files, though it may not with
just having to look up a single one. We would have the rows holding 2M each, so we could
grab a row and then delete it. We would have to VACUUM the database every once in a while
or it would grow to be enormous. BUT HONESTLY IT WOULD END UP BEING THE SAME AS IT WAS 
BEFORE with random-collector hoging the database while random-add starves. Or would it?

Should test the database idea for two processes adding and removin data.
